# ðŸŽ­ Personas

## Before you get started

Please note, that within what is possible in the game, you can only add **two more** unique Persona slots. The other unused slots are being used by Compendium Restoration Pack and Joker's Personas respectively, leaving every other mod to use the leftover two slots. If you have plans of adding more than that, reconsider what is possible before getting started.
