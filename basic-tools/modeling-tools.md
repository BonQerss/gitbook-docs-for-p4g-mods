## PSP Tools

PSP Tools contains 4 applications, almost all are needed for working with model files. GMOView helps you preview your model before getting into the game. GMOConv can convert various model formats (FBX, GMS, AMD) into viewable GMO files. GIMConv helps convert between various texture formats.

## Magick

Magick is a command line tool helpful for automating image edits. You can resize images, remove transparency, swap Red and Blue channels for fixing gim textures, and hundreds of other features.&#x20;

## Sadoaiya

Sadoaiya is similar to GMOConv but optimized around Vita use. It can remove vertex colors, optimize models for Vita use, add in blend subsets, as well as a dozen other GMO-specific features.
