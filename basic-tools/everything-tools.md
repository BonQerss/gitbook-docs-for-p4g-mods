# ‚õè Everything Tools

{% hint style="info" %}
**IMPORTANT!** Tools listed here are what you'll need across the board. Extra required tools will be listed in the sections that need them.
{% endhint %}

## Notepad++

The best text editor with a sleuth of options, suitable for working with almost anything Persona related. Improved performance over the base Notepad app that comes stock with Windows.

## Amicitia

Helpful for extracting files from archives and viewing TMX files.

## CriFsLib

Needed for unpacking base files of both PC and Vita. You'll need to have access to all files in order to make most mods.

## 010 Editor

The best hex editor for working with Persona games. Templates help you understand and change data contained inside of TBL files, as well as add/extend parts of other files such as AMD.
